The objective of a house property price data science project is to build a predictive model that can estimate the price of a house based on its features. Here are specific objectives related to the features of the house:<br/>
<b>1-	Feature Importance Analysis:</b><br/>
Identify and rank the importance of different features in influencing the house price. This helps in understanding which characteristics have the most significant impact.<br/>
<<b>2-	Feature Engineering:</b><br/>
Explore and create new features that might better capture the underlying patterns in the data, improving the model's predictive performance.<br/>
<b>3-	Addressing Missing Values:</b><br/>
Develop strategies for handling missing values in the dataset, such as imputation or exclusion of instances with missing data:</b><br/>
